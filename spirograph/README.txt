For the visualizer and data points generation, please refer to this fiddle for a live demo:
https://jsfiddle.net/uznprthe/9/

The file "spiro_primer.kml" has the point coords needed to generate the shapefile used with ArcGIS, in turn generated by the js script "generator.js".
The file "spiro_shapefiles.zip" has the aforementioned shapefiles.
The folder "Visualizer_html" contains a self-sufficient spirograph visualizer without the point generation, able to be run locally via a web browser.
